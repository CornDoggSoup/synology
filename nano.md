# Nano Editor

If you hate Vim like I do, here's how to install Nano :)


## Add the SynoCommunity Repo

1. DSM > Package Center 
2. Settings button > Package Sources tab > Add
3. Name = SynoCommunity
4. Location = https://packages.synocommunity.com/
5. OK
6. A Community tab is added to Package Center


## Install SynoCli File Tools

Nano used to be its own package. Now it is installed with SynoCli File Tools which adds these commands:

```bash
less, tree, ncdu, jdupes, rhash, mc (midnight-commander), 
nano, file, detox, rmlint, rnm, pcre2, zstd
```

1. DSM > Package Center > Community tah
2. Search for and install SynoCli File Tools
3. Accept the 3rd party warning


## Test

There's nothing to restart - go ahead and `nano` :)
